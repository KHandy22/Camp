# Camp Registration

## Overview
This assignment has two tasks:
- **Task 1:** Collect camper information using `input()`
- **Task 2:** Convert variables to appropriate data types

## Instructions

### Task 1
Open `task1.py`. For each `# TODO`, add an `input()` statement that:
- Uses the prompt shown in the comment
- Stores the result in the variable named in the comment

### Task 2
Open `task2.py`. The import statement brings in variables as strings.
Convert each variable to the appropriate data type. Not all variables need conversion.

## Submitting Your Work
1. Complete **both tasks** before pushing
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Check the Actions tab on GitHub to see your test results

By pushing through PyCharm with git, all tasks are submitted together — you'll see a check on each task if everything is correct.
